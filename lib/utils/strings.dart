      "\n"
      "(c) All insurance policies of Carrier required by this Agreement must, as applicable, be primary and must waive subrogation and contribution against Broker and Shipper. Carrier represents and warrants that there are no exclusions or limitations under any such policies that would prevent coverage for any liability assumed by Carrier under this Agreement. Carrier will furnish to Broker written certificates obtained from the insurance carrier showing that such insurance has been procured, is properly maintained, and indicating the expiration date of the relevant policies. Carrier will provide Broker written notice of cancellation or material modification of any of the foregoing policies at least thirty (30) days prior to such cancellation or modification. In addition, Broker and Shipper must be included or added as additional insureds on Carrier’s CGL Insurance and Auto Insurance policies and Shipper must be added as a loss payee on Carrier’s Cargo Insurance policy, in each case, as evidenced by an endorsement on the certificates of insurance. Upon Broker’s written request, Carrier will provide Broker with copies of the foregoing insurance policies. All of the foregoing insurance policies must be procured from insurance companies"
